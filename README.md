# Story
1. **Introduction** 

1) In more humid condition the droplets containing virus come from sneezing or coughing come down to floor quickly and within few minutes drop containing virus settle to floor and hence virus transmission reduces so much.
But in low humidity condition the drops containing the virus long last about hours.
 2) UV light has been used for years to kill bacteria and viruses and ultraviolet light has been used as a disinfectant for a century in hospitals and water supplies. It shatters the genetic material inside viruses, bacteria and other microbes. Menachery said, and disinfecting UV light canâ€™t be used with people around because it damages human cells.

As it damage human cells so it should not be used in presence of human but we can use it over the internet to make our home and working places sanitize and reduce the risk of covid-19 without our presence at that place.
UV light is lethal to viruses because of its high frequency that scramble and damage their nuclear material .when it damage the DNA (or RNA) codes of these pathogens it also trigger lethal mutation that prevent them from reproducing themselves.
